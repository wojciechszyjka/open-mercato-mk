# Standalone Open Mercato App — Agent Rules

Extend this app. Route first; never probe unmatched context.

## Always

- Route all axes; missing context: `yarn mercato agentic:init --update-harness`.
- App code: `src/modules/<id>/`; framework context only for a named version gap.
- Derive trusted `tenantId` + `organizationId` and fail closed. Only an installed contract may use system scope (`organizationId: null`).
- Use commands, `makeCrudRoute`, `CrudForm`/`DataTable`, DI, events, and UMES on canonical paths.
- Put entities in `src/modules/<id>/data/entities.ts`; API routes need per-method `metadata` + `openApi`.
- Editable records expose `updated_at`/`updatedAt`; custom update/delete clients send the version and surface 409s.
- Run `yarn db:generate`, review scoped SQL/snapshot, and ask before applying it.
- Run `yarn generate` after discovery files, `src/modules.ts`, routes, pages, events, widgets, agents, tools, or workflows change.
- Adding/changing/removing, preserving, or keeping stable a public route/schema/ID/export/seam/signature/event-payload/CLI MUST read `.ai/guides/upstream/BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`; tenant/org scope alone is not a contract surface.
- Localize strings; use shared UI/tokens and complete loading, empty, error, conflict, keyboard, and a11y states.

## Ask First

- Ask before scope/architecture/public-contract/dependency/ejection/canonical-primitive changes; migrations/resets/DB targets; live credentials/providers; or weaker security, concurrency, retries, idempotency, audit, undo.

## Never

- Never leak tenants, trust payload scope, or treat missing scope as unrestricted.
- Never edit `node_modules`, `.mercato/generated/**`, generated facts, or shipped migrations.
- Never use cross-module ORM relations; use IDs/snapshots, events, enrichers, extensions, or optional DI.
- Never use raw admin `fetch`/`<form>`, ad hoc crypto/cache/queues, role-name guards, or direct mutations when helpers exist.
- Never hard-code user strings/status colors; expose secrets/transcripts; or guess answerable contracts.

## Validation

Use the smallest relevant set. Broad: `yarn generate && yarn typecheck && yarn lint && yarn test && yarn build`; integration: `yarn test:integration:ephemeral`. Report failures; never migrate to validate.

## Three-Axis Context Assembler

Routes are additive: ownership says WHO; other axes say WHAT. Select every match.

`debugging` is additive. A scalar-ID/snapshot fix to persisted records or commands linked to an installed record MUST use `module-data` + `umes` and load `om-data-model-design` + `om-system-extension`.

`debugging` = reported bug/security/drift, not designed failure UI. Specs use `spec-pr`; implementation owns domain guides. Custom fields/entities = `umes` + `module-data` + `om-data-model-design`; editable round trips add `backend-ui`, requested coverage adds `testing`. Never infer work from specs/PRs.

Unified-override audits = `umes` only; add `architecture`/`framework-context` only for unresolved ownership or installed keys. Durable process/activity/user task = `module-data` + `ai-workflow`. Multi-stage waits/cancel/restart are durable; reminders and renewal/batch schedules are `module-data`.

`backend-ui`: replacing/wrapping, prop-transforming, menu-editing, or adding visible feedback adds `backend-ui`; merely hiding/toggling/rewiring installed UI does not.
Staff UI preview/report/bulk = `backend-ui`.
Existing installed form/table fields, filters, row/bulk actions without app persistence = `umes` + `backend-ui` only: read `crud-surfaces` + `quality-states`; do not load contracts, module-scaffold, or page/navigation.

`backend-ui`: UI skill `references/quality-states.md`; public/portal/responsive/a11y adds `frontend-and-design-system.md`.

### Axis 1 — Area/Ownership

| Route | Match | Context |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture` | Capability/ownership/field-vs-history choice, boundary, upgrade, override, or registry failure; routine discovery stays in its area | `.ai/guides/architecture.md` + named facts |
| `module-data` | App-owned domain/data/API | `src/modules/<id>/` + `.ai/guides/contracts.md`; add architecture only when ownership is unresolved |
| `umes` | Extend/replace installed behavior | `.ai/guides/extensions.md` + named facts |
| `backend-ui` | Authored/restyled rendered surface or browser UI state/session bootstrap | `.ai/guides/backend-ui.md` + host facts; host-provided integration credentials/health UI alone does not match |
| `integration` | Provider, spreadsheet/CSV/file I/O, sync/webhook/storage | `.ai/guides/integrations.md`; imports = `integration`; AI consuming files = `ai-workflow`, NEVER `integration` unless transport/storage changes |
| `ai-workflow` | Agent/tool/MCP/orchestrator/durable workflow | `.ai/guides/ai-workflows.md` + facts; schedules/queues/workers/retries/progress alone are `module-data` |
| `debugging` | Bug/security/drift/runtime inconsistency | `.ai/guides/testing-debugging.md` + affected areas |

API/command/record/status/event/UI changes/guards = `umes`; app persistence = `module-data`; installed guard without app persistence = `umes` only, so do not load contracts; read-only behavior/auth/dependents/customization = `framework-context` (alone: no extensions guide; report `installed-version`). Facts do not. Providers are published, never `packages/*`.

### Axis 2 — Work Units

Match every work-unit row; OPEN its skill before selection.

| Route | Work unit | Skill/context |
|---|---|---|
| `architecture` | Explain/choose module, UMES, package, eject | architecture; `om-help` for an unresolved or comparative choice across these mechanisms |
| `module-data` | Business slice or multi-seam domain/API/command fix | MUST load `om-module-scaffold` + its exact `.ai/skills/om-module-scaffold/references/business-one-shot-blueprints.md` key, which resolves units inside the slice, not ownership — an ownership/capability outline adds `architecture` |
| `spec-pr` | Spec/plan | Axis 3; phases+integration coverage (`integration-coverage`); no domain routes |
| `architecture` | Upgrade audit or disable built-in | troubleshooter + framework context, or trim skill + exact `src/modules.ts`/`package.json` |
| `architecture` + `integration` + `framework-context` | Provider superseded by installed capability | integration builder + exact framework context |
| `module-data` | Entity/link/validator/migration/encryption/lock/transaction | `om-data-model-design` + contracts |
| `module-data` | CRUD/API/command/OpenAPI/ACL/setup/mutation | `om-module-scaffold` + contracts |
| `backend-ui` | Form/table/page/renderer/middleware/nav/i18n/UI states | `om-backend-ui-design` + backend UI |
| `module-data` | Search/analytics/event/notification/message/worker/progress/cache/CLI | scaffold + contracts |
| `umes` | Fields/extension entities/links/enrichers/injection/interceptors/guards/subscribers/DOM/widgets/toggles/overrides | `om-system-extension` + extensions; choices load `mechanism-selector` + `extension-branches` |
| `integration` | Provider/credentials/health/webhook/files/client/reconciliation/package | `om-integration-builder` + integrations |
| `ai-workflow` | Agent/tool/MCP/OpenCode/Code Mode/orchestrator/AI file or content drafting/attachment/override | `om-create-ai-agent` + AI/workflows; MCP/OpenCode loads `surface-selector` + `ai_assistant` facts |
| `ai-workflow` | Workflow/activity/user task/idempotency/output/progress | `om-build-workflow` + AI/workflows |
| `testing` | REQUEST says test/coverage/prove, or verify by exercising API/browser/screen sizes/keyboard/screen-reader—not a fix's implicit regression duty or review/audit/config check | MUST read `.ai/guides/testing-debugging.md` + external `om-integration-tests` for integration/E2E/app tests |
| `debugging` | Reproduce/root-cause/minimal fix/regression oracle | `om-troubleshooter` + testing/debugging |
| `framework-context` | Exact installed contract still unknown | bounded `om-framework-context`, last |
| `debugging` + `testing` | Add/fix recurring harness case/test | `om-evolve-harness` |

`framework-context`: resolve one named module/framework fact first. Use bounded source only for an unresolved exact contract, current behavior, authorization, dependents, or safest customization seam; never for “installed contracts” alone.

### Axis 3 — SDLC and Delivery

Pinned delivery skills: `yarn install-skills` (refresh: `--update`). Read BOTH `.agents/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` and a matching `.ai/skills/<id>/SKILL.md` override. Commit+ready PR MUST add `spec-pr`, read `.ai/skills/om-auto-create-pr/SKILL.md`, and keep task routes (`delivery-route-preserves-task-routes`).

| Route ID | Delivery need | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| `spec-pr` | Write/revise spec | MUST invoke `om-spec-writing` (OMH-005) + `.ai/guides/spec-delivery.md` + config specs path |
| `spec-pr` | Implement approved phases locally | `om-implement-spec` (OMH-006) |
| `spec-pr` | Whole-spec / commit+ready PR / issue / review | `om-auto-implement-spec` / `om-auto-create-pr` / `om-auto-fix-issue` / `om-auto-review-pr` |
| `testing` | Integration/E2E/UI QA | `om-integration-tests` / `om-auto-qa-pr` |
| — | No PR/spec workflow requested | Do not load delivery skills |

Absent skill: run `yarn install-skills` once; never substitute.

### Token-Efficient Assembly Policy

- Load matched guides once, then only needed references/facts.
- Hard budgets: guide > skill > references; open a reference only for its named subject.
- Specs: open one match; `spec-pr` reads template via spec-delivery.
- Inspect app call sites before bounded `framework-context`.
- Additive page/form/table/conflict UI skips it.
- Never bulk-read guide, skill, fact, or source trees.

## Module-Specific Facts

Load facts for every named/targeted module, not incidental use. Mechanisms: events/subscribers→events; long operation/progress→progress; provider settings/health/OAuth→integrations; sync/import→data_sync. Hosts: session/auth→auth; customer/contact/deal/pipeline→customers; product/price/stock/inventory→catalog; currency/money→currencies; cart/checkout/shopper→checkout; portal→portal + customer_accounts; quote/order/invoice/sales assistant→sales; notification→notifications; webhook/callback→webhooks; schedule/reminder→scheduler; workflow/activity/user task→workflows; assistant→ai_assistant; maintained query index/reindex→query_index; search convergence→search. staff/employee≠optional staff; audit/record-who≠audit_logs unless extended. App primitives skip api_docs/search/query_index unless changed.

<!-- om:module-guides:start -->
<!-- om:module-guides:end -->

## Working Sequence

1. `spec-pr`: list `.ai/specs` once; open one match; plan-only skips specs.
2. Route; load only matched guides/skills/facts.
3. Implement the smallest complete slice through real call sites.
4. Discovery change: run `yarn generate`; then the smallest gate/integration paths.

Precedence: root → BC → installed `AGENTS.md` → facts; stop on skew/conflict; never guess.
