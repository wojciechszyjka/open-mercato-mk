# Extension Mechanism Selector

Load this reference before choosing files.

| Requirement | Smallest mechanism |
|---|---|
| Add computed/list/detail fields | Response enricher; add a widget only when UI is also needed. |
| Enrich query-engine reads | Enricher with `queryEngine.enabled`; preserve `*.querying`/`*.queried` lifecycle contracts. |
| Validate/rewrite host request or add response data | API interceptor. |
| Add behavior before/after command execute or undo | `commands/interceptors.ts` command interceptor with stable `id`/`targetCommand`. |
| Block/rewrite host mutation with post-success work | Mutation guard contract. |
| Add form/table/menu/page content | Headless/rendered widget injection. |
| Filter a client widget reaction | Widget `eventHandlers.filter.operations`. |
| Persist app-owned data against host record | Extension entity with scalar host ID. |
| React synchronously or asynchronously | Typed subscriber; use `metadata.sync`/`priority` only for in-pipeline lifecycle work. |
| React to a browser event | Reactive notification handler, or `clientBroadcast` plus `useAppEvent`/`useOperationProgress`. |
| Add provider setup/status/detail UI | Typed integration definition plus integration wizard/status/detail widget injection. |
| Add vector, embedded AI, or provider/domain behavior | `vector.ts`, `<AiChat>`, or the typed payment/shipping/currency/workflow registry; add the owning specialist skill. |
| Adjust component behavior | Props transform, wrapper, then replacement. |
| Hide/replace supported route/page/agent/tool/etc. | `src/modules.ts` unified override. |
| Change unsupported internals | Eject only after explicit approval. |

Resolve exact targets from the named module sheet's `UMES hosts` and `UMES contributions` first. Use `.ai/guides/framework-extension-points.md` for framework-owned menus, dashboard, notification, integration, and shell targets. Follow `fact-ref` and `specialistRoute` provenance instead of inventing a generic target; use exact installed context only for one named fact gap. `optional-external` degrades when its package is absent, while an `unresolved` first-party target blocks implementation.

If multiple mechanisms are required (for example editable field = widget + enricher + interceptor), follow the shared `roundTripId`, name one owner for each read/write/UI leg, and test them as one round trip. Select only facts marked bound: DataTable's rendered header/footer/toolbar/search-trailing, headless columns/row-actions/bulk-actions/filters, and component handle; CrudForm's base/header/fields, component handle, and declared lifecycle/operation-filter pipeline. Base prefixes and helper-only/unbound IDs are not mountable. Reactive notifications, messages/inbox, query/vector, integrations, and AI/workflow work also select their owning task route; UMES does not replace that specialist context.

Prefer additive composition before replacement (`additive-before-replacement`). Ejection is the last resort after supported seams are proven insufficient and explicit approval is granted (`eject-last`).
