/**
 * Command-layer optimistic-lock coverage guard (record_locks decision map).
 *
 * Scans EVERY workspace package for direct `enforceCommandOptimisticLock(` call
 * sites and asserts each file is either:
 *   (a) migrated to the async DI-aware seam `enforceCommandOptimisticLockWithGuards`
 *       (so the optional enterprise `record_locks` guard is awaited — i.e. the
 *       site's record_locks decision is "enabled"), OR
 *   (b) present in the explicit COMMAND_GUARD_ALLOWLIST below with a concrete
 *       record_locks decision (OSS-only / exempt, or "migrated in Part B").
 *
 * Phase 6b parts A and B migrated every "enabled" command site (core AND the
 * `checkout` / `webhooks` packages) to the async seam, so those files dropped
 * out of this scan naturally. What remains in the allowlist is, by construction,
 * only the intentional OSS-only / exempt sites.
 *
 * A NEW direct `enforceCommandOptimisticLock(` site that is neither migrated nor
 * allowlisted fails this test — it must carry a record_locks decision.
