# Standalone AI Development Harness

- **Status:** Implemented — deterministic and focused remediation gates green; complete multi-runner release certification continues in #4670
- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Scope:** OSS, standalone applications emitted by `create-mercato-app` only
- **Tracking plan:** `.ai/runs/2026-07-24-standalone-app-ai-harness.md`
- **Supersedes on acceptance for this scope:** `.ai/specs/2026-06-05-ai-harness-single-shot-optimization.md`, `.ai/specs/2026-06-27-create-app-agentic-skills-restructure.md`, and the unfinished standalone-specific parts of `.ai/specs/2026-06-27-ts-morph-module-fact-sheets.md`

## 📝 TLDR

Replace the AI coding context emitted into a fresh standalone app with one compact task router, progressively loaded task guides and thin local skills, generated installed-module facts, exact-version access to the framework source and its original `AGENTS.md` hierarchy, and an executable evaluation catalog. Keep PR/spec/review automation sourced from `open-mercato/skills`; keep standalone architecture knowledge local and testable. Optimize for real one-shot module/UMES/integration/AI/workflow work and for the bug, security, scoping, concurrency, bootstrap, and contract-drift failures that dominate project history.

## Resolved assumptions (autonomous defaults)

1. **One delivery, independently verifiable slices:** this specification covers the standalone AI development harness as one requested delivery, but its context/router, installer/generator, and evaluation slices have separate acceptance gates and rollback boundaries. A phase may land only while the generated app remains usable and cross-phase compatibility tests stay green.
2. **Standalone boundary:** no monorepo contributor harness or shared skills-collection procedure is rewritten. Shared automation is selected and installed; standalone domain knowledge and overrides remain in create-app assets.
3. **Source-context boundary:** installed framework source and package/module `AGENTS.md` files are read-only reference material. The harness may locate and read them explicitly despite `node_modules` ignore rules, but never edits them.
4. **Evaluation boundary:** deterministic schema/routing/consistency/scaffold gates are CI-authoritative. Read-only Codex/Claude runs evaluate routing only. Writable implementation/regression runs use disposable scaffolds and executable oracles. One explicitly selected primary runner owns every blocking live lane; a different secondary runner may be requested for the representative read-only portability lane without making secondary authentication a prerequisite for an ordinary release.
5. **Migration boundary:** fresh scaffolds get the new layout. `mercato agentic:init` upgrades generated harness assets idempotently without deleting user-authored skills or instructions.
6. **Judge boundary:** every writable generative evaluation is judged after deterministic checks, and the same read-only skill can judge a sanitized session bundle shared by a user. Session text and generated artifacts remain untrusted evidence; they never become executable instructions.

## 📝 Problem Statement

The current standalone harness contains two divergent root instruction files, very large overlapping local skills, stale examples, tool hooks that target obsolete paths, a POSIX-plus-`jq` installer in a Node-based cross-platform app, duplicated generator copy lists, stale built assets, no live-agent evaluation, and no reliable route to exact installed framework context when the summaries are insufficient. This causes excess prompt cost and, more importantly, agents choosing outdated contracts or monorepo-only paths.

## 📝 Proposed Solution

Build a four-layer harness:

1. A boundary-first root `AGENTS.md` that only routes tasks and carries universal safety rules.
2. Focused guides and thin standalone skills loaded only for the selected task.
3. Generated module facts plus an exact installed-source/original-AGENTS escape hatch.
4. A versioned 203-case catalog with deterministic checks, live Codex/Claude routing evaluation, and a skill for adding future cases without bloating the root prompt.

## 📝 Architecture

### Design principles

1. **Route before loading.** Root instructions contain only universal boundaries, a task-family router, validation rules, and pointers. They do not teach full CRUD/UMES/provider procedures.
2. **One knowledge owner.** A contract is stated in one authoritative guide/reference. Other files point to it; a consistency gate rejects duplicate contradictory examples.
3. **Facts from installed code.** Module IDs, APIs/auth, events, ACL features, DI tokens, search entities, notifications, and stable host tokens come from generated facts or the exact installed package source, never a hand-maintained module tutorial.
4. **Skills are routers plus procedures.** Trigger-rich frontmatter stays small; per-branch procedure, templates, and checklists live in `references/` and are loaded only when the chosen path needs them.
5. **Automation is shared; domain context is local.** PR/spec/review/issue skills come from `open-mercato/skills`. Standalone paths, module architecture, provider patterns, and framework-context resolution live in create-app.
6. **Every harness rule earns a case.** A recurring failure becomes a semantic evaluation assertion before it becomes more prose.

### Root instruction contract

The generated `AGENTS.md` MUST:

- use the exact `Always`, `Ask First`, `Never`, and `Validation Commands` boundaries;
- stay at or below 12 KiB and avoid long code examples, leaving substantial headroom under Codex's 32,768-byte default project-instruction budget reported in issue #4484;
- identify the app as a standalone extension layer over read-only installed packages;
- route a task to all matching task families (module/data, UI, UMES, integration, AI/workflows, debugging, spec/PR automation);
- route module-specific analysis to generated facts first and `om-framework-context` only when those facts are insufficient;
- scan the lesson index by selected router areas, exact modules, and important topics, then load only matching app-local records;
- preserve tenant/organization scope, canonical mutation/data helpers, auto-discovery, migrations/snapshots, `yarn generate`, and no-edit rules for generated files/`node_modules`;
- never hard-code a tool-specific skills directory for external skills;
- contain only generated module-fact rows between stable markers so `agentic:init` can replace them idempotently.

The deterministic budget gate measures bytes, not characters. It caps both standalone root sources at 12 KiB and checks representative generated root-only, module/data, UI, integration, and AI initial chains against Codex's 32,768-byte default. It also caps every daily `SKILL.md` router at 120 lines/12 KiB unless explicitly allowlisted with a reason. Each case declares initial routed-context and total-context byte budgets; progressive references and generated module facts are charged to total context rather than the initial bundle. Token estimates and actually accessed bytes are recorded in live results and compared with the checked-in baseline.

The bare `packages/create-app/template/AGENTS.md` becomes the same small safety/router contract with an explicit `agentic:init` fallback when local skills are absent. Agentic setup enriches generated module rows and tool configuration; it does not replace the app's architecture rules with a second conflicting document. The emitted lesson index starts empty: monorepo framework lessons are not copied into an app. The index and every emitted nested lesson asset are user-editable ownership-manifest entries; app-added records remain unknown user assets. Harness refresh therefore preserves local knowledge and emits `.incoming` candidates on generated-path conflicts.

### Local skill catalog

| Skill | When to use | Required reference branches |
|---|---|---|
| `om-help` | Select the smallest workflow/skill for an unfamiliar request. | task families, external automation sequences |
| `om-module-scaffold` | New module or complete entity/CRUD vertical slice. | planning, entity/migration, CRUD/API, ACL/setup, commands/events/search, verification |
| `om-data-model-design` | Entity, relation, sensitive field, migration, snapshot, locking, or atomic-write decisions. | scopes/columns, cross-module links, encryption, migrations, concurrency |
| `om-backend-ui-design` | Backend/frontend/portal pages, forms, tables, navigation, i18n, accessibility, DS. | page types, forms/tables, navigation/overrides, translations, validation |
| `om-system-extension` | UMES enrichers/interceptors/guards/widgets/menus/extensions/events/replacements. | mechanism selector plus one reference per extension family |
| `om-integration-builder` | Email, shipping, payment, data-sync, webhook, storage, or other provider integration. | provider selection, package/adapter, credentials/security, reliability, activation/tests |
| `om-create-ai-agent` | Typed module AI agent/tool/UI part/orchestrator/subagent work. | agent/tool contracts, mutation approval, orchestrator files, attachments/artifacts, overrides |
| `om-build-workflow` | Workflow activities, triggers, durable user tasks, outputs, idempotency, progress. | activity contracts, transaction/idempotency, events/UI, testing |
| `om-troubleshooter` | Bug diagnosis and minimal verified repair. | generator/bootstrap, data integrity/scope, UI/hydration, cache/search, provider reliability |
| `om-framework-context` | Generated facts are insufficient and the exact installed framework implementation/AGENTS hierarchy is needed. | resolver procedure, narrow source search, version/skew report, upstream-report boundary |
| `om-evolve-harness` | Add a new harness use case or correct a failed routing/implementation pattern. | case capture/schema, owner selection, affected-case calculation, before/after eval |
| `om-judge-agent-session` | Judge a harness eval result or a user-shared session bundle and identify artifact defects plus the smallest harness owner to improve. | input normalization, fixed evidence, code/DS review, harness-owner diagnosis, report contract |
| `om-eject-and-customize` | UMES/overrides cannot provide the required behavior and an installed module must be copied into app source. | decision gate, eject procedure, upgrade ownership |
| `om-implement-spec` | Implement selected standalone spec phases interactively without PR automation. | spec resolution, confirmed phase-derived plan, progress, review/test gates, stable local report/reference output |
| `om-trim-unused-modules` | Disable unused built-ins after dependency analysis. | dependency analysis, modules.ts edit, generation/cache validation |

Existing public local skill names remain available. Their old monolithic bodies are replaced, not aliased to stale content. Version-specific upgrade skills remain opt-in and are not part of the daily routing surface.

### Shared skill selection

The default external source remains `open-mercato/skills`, pinned to a tested commit in `tiers.json`; the installer CLI is pinned independently. Install the smallest dependency-closed set needed for daily standalone delivery:

- authoring/review: `om-spec-writing`, `om-code-review`, `om-integration-tests`, `om-prepare-test-env`;
- one-shot/resumable PR delivery: `om-auto-create-pr`, `om-auto-continue-pr`, `om-auto-review-pr`, `om-auto-implement-spec`, `om-auto-qa-pr`;
- issue autofix chain: `om-auto-fix-issue`, `om-verify-in-repo`, `om-root-cause`, `om-fix`, `om-open-pr`;
- pipeline maintenance: `om-setup-agent-pipeline`.

The loop engines, issue authoring/management, and upgrade-note workflow are opt-in because their full dependency closure is not required for daily delivery. `external.tiers.core` owns the 15-skill daily set; `external.tiers.automation` owns those five advanced entry points, selected with the same `--with automation`, `--tiers automation`, or `--all` contract as local tiers. Dependency closure is computed before installation, so an exact opt-in tier still receives every prerequisite. The manifest MUST encode and test the hard dependency closure rather than keeping that graph only in test code. It records the tested collection commit and resolved per-skill content hashes; ordinary re-runs never update to collection HEAD. External skills never also appear in a local tier. A same-name local folder is an override and is never linked over the installed skill.

### Exact installed framework context escape hatch

Published `@open-mercato/*` packages already carry their TypeScript `src/` trees and their package/module `AGENTS.md` files. Generic search misses them because `node_modules` is ignored. `scripts/framework-context.mjs` and `om-framework-context` turn that latent context into an explicit, narrow, version-correct path:

1. Resolve a requested module from the app root using Node package resolution for the packages declared by `src/modules.ts`; only then inspect that resolved package's `src/modules/<module>` tree. Do not select an arbitrary hoisted/transitive duplicate.
2. Read the installed package version and source root.
3. Return the instruction chain and its concern-specific precedence: standalone root wins for safety, ownership, and writable paths; the BC snapshot wins for frozen public identifiers; the nearest installed package/module `AGENTS.md` wins for version-specific framework contracts; the upstream root snapshot is contextual only. An unresolved contradiction is a hard diagnostic, not an invitation to guess.
4. Return exact source paths and a bounded search command using `rg --no-ignore --hidden` scoped to that package/module; never run an unbounded `node_modules` search.
5. Reject stale generated facts when their stamped package version does not match the package resolved from the app root. Report duplicate versions and snapshot skew; never silently combine them.
6. If a package omits `src/`, degrade to `dist/` plus type declarations and state that source-level analysis is limited. Network fetching is an explicit fallback, never the default.
7. Treat all upstream content as read-only. A required framework change becomes an upstream issue/PR or an explicit eject decision; the standalone task never patches `node_modules`.

The ordinary case policy therefore treats explicit, module-fact-linked reads below a resolved `node_modules/@open-mercato/<package>/src/**` root as warning-level context, not a forbidden access. Broad dependency-tree discovery, undeclared packages, executable dependency artifacts, and every write below `node_modules` remain forbidden. The evaluator records each installed-source read so useful examples do not weaken containment.

`packages/create-app/build.mjs` snapshots the repository root `AGENTS.md` and `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` into the built agentic assets. `packages/cli` already republishes those create-app agentic assets, so the resolver can read a release-matched snapshot from installed `@open-mercato/cli` after the npx scaffold process is gone.

### Installer contract

Replace the generated installer's shell implementation with a Node 24 script while preserving the `yarn install-skills` command and existing flags:

- `--with`, `--tiers`, `--all`, `--list`, `--clean`, `--legacy-links`, `--ignore-agents`, `--no-external`;
- `OM_SKIP_EXTERNAL_SKILLS=1` offline behavior;
- canonical `.agents/skills/<name>` ownership;
- Claude compatibility links only by default; Codex/Cursor use `.agents/skills` directly;
- safe migration/sweeping of legacy directory-level or per-agent links;
- external install before local links, because the external CLI owns the canonical directory; stage and verify the complete selected dependency-closed set, retain every previous destination as a backup, activate all selected skills, and publish the ownership ledger only after the whole set succeeds; any failure restores the complete prior set before the non-fatal local-only continuation;
- repeated `--skill <name>` arguments (never a comma-packed wildcard);
- a pinned `skills` CLI version plus explicit `open-mercato/skills` commit stored in the manifest;
- process spawning with argument arrays and Windows-aware executable resolution;
- no `jq`, POSIX shell, interactive prompt, or git-checkout requirement;
- non-fatal external network failure after local skills are installed, with a clear retry command;
- `install-skills.sh` retained as a small compatibility wrapper for existing direct callers.

Every generated call site uses Node directly: the package script, create-app wizard, and CLI `agentic:init` invoke `process.execPath` with `scripts/install-skills.mjs`. The bare template ships a successful Node placeholder before agentic setup. The compatibility shell wrapper is never on an automatic Windows path.

### Generator and ownership contract

- `packages/create-app/agentic/` remains the single source for standalone harness assets.
- The create-app wizard and `packages/cli` `agentic:init` MUST use the same recursive text-aware copy contract; hard-coded per-skill file lists are removed.
- The common mapping is `shared/AGENTS.md.template` → `AGENTS.md`, `shared/ai/**` → `.ai/**`, and `shared/scripts/**` → `scripts/**`; files are traversed in deterministic order. Placeholder substitution applies to an explicit text-extension allowlist, while binary assets are copied byte-for-byte with safe modes.
- Re-running setup replaces only generated marker blocks and known generated assets. It never deletes an unknown/user-authored `.ai/skills/*` directory.
- `build.mjs` clears `dist/agentic` before copying to prevent deleted skills or legacy `STANDALONE.md` files from shipping.
- Both create-app and CLI builds independently clear and repopulate their output `agentic` trees and write version/source-hashed upstream root/BC snapshots; neither assumes it is copying the other's already-built output.
- A generated manifest records the owned file set and source hash so upgrades can distinguish unmodified generated assets from user modifications.
- Tool-specific files add enforcement/hook behavior only. They do not restate the architecture. Entity hooks/globs target `src/modules/*/data/entities.ts`.
- Module facts add `sourcePackage`, `sourceVersion`, and an app-relative `sourceRoot` while retaining the existing `coreVersion` field as a compatibility bridge. API routes, backend pages, frontend pages, CLI commands, exposed AI tools/MCP capabilities, and AI agents include source links into the exact installed package, including `node_modules` paths. The existing `cli: string[]` field remains as a compatibility bridge beside source-linked `cliCommands`. A valid empty enabled-module intersection remains empty; only an actual `src/modules.ts` parse failure may fall back to all bundled facts.
- The generated module marker is an identifier-only enabled-module index plus one `.ai/guides/modules/<id>.md` loading rule. It never embeds module descriptions or repeats one fact-sheet path per module; detailed facts remain progressively loaded from the named/targeted module sheet.

The manifest is finalized atomically only after shared emission, module-row injection, tool patching, and persisted agent selection. Relative paths are normalized and rejected if they escape the app root. Rerun behavior is explicit:

| Existing state | Default setup | `--update-harness` | `--force` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Owned and hash unchanged | Existing-file warning and no-op. | Replace/update and refresh hash. | Replace. |
| Owned but user-modified | Existing-file warning and no-op. | Preserve; write an adjacent `.incoming` candidate and report conflict. | Replace. |
| Unknown/user-authored | Preserve. | Preserve; an exact-path collision gets `.incoming`. | Preserve unless it is an exact generated target. |
| Missing prior owned file | Existing-file policy applies to the selected tool. | Recreate if still emitted. | Recreate. |
| Missing/corrupt manifest | Existing-file policy applies. | Treat existing targets as unknown, preserve them, and emit `.incoming`; add missing targets. | Replace exact generated targets, never unrelated unknown files. |

`agentic:init --tool` and `--force` keep their existing meaning and default no-force early-exit behavior. The additive `--update-harness` path performs the ownership-aware upgrade. Candidate generation and validation happen in staging; every managed source and destination is resolved below a canonical root and every existing ancestor is checked with `lstat`, so `.ai`/`.agents` or a deeper managed ancestor cannot redirect a write through a symlink. The manifest is renamed atomically only after file publication succeeds. External skill installation runs afterward as a separate, non-fatal phase, so an offline registry does not invalidate the emitted harness manifest.

## 📝 Data Model

This feature adds no runtime database model. It defines versioned JSON contracts for catalog cases, validator/release matrices, generated ownership, routing/review responses, writable/target-validation evidence, and sanitized release results.

### Harness case record

Each object in `.ai/harness/cases.json` contains:

```ts
type HarnessCase = {
  id: string
  title: string
  family: 'architecture' | 'module' | 'umes' | 'integration' | 'ai-workflow' | 'bugfix' | 'business' | 'testing'
  mode: 'analysis' | 'one-shot' | 'spec' | 'bugfix' | 'review'
  evaluationKind: 'static' | 'routing' | 'implementation' | 'regression'
  risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
  prompt: string
  tags: string[]
  owner: { kind: 'root' | 'guide' | 'skill' | 'facts' | 'hook'; path: string; ruleIds: string[] }
  expectedRouter: { required: string[]; allowedExtra?: string[] }
  requiredSkills: string[]
  optionalSkills?: Array<{ id: string; route: string }>
  context: { required: string[]; allowedExtra?: string[]; warn?: string[]; forbidden: string[] }
  requiredDecisions: string[]
  forbiddenPatterns: string[]
  validators: string[]
  fixture?: { scaffold: string; setup: string[]; expectedFailure?: string }
  oracle?: { validatorIds: string[]; expectedArtifacts?: string[] }
  allowedWrites?: string[]
  maxContextFiles: number
  maxInitialContextBytes: number
  maxTotalContextBytes: number
  relatedCases: string[]
  source?: { prs?: string[]; paths?: string[] }
}
```

Router matching uses required-subset semantics; `allowedExtra` caps permitted extra routes. Context paths use app-relative exact paths or explicit globs. Validators are IDs from a checked-in registry and never arbitrary shell copied from evidence. Static checks observe files directly; live routing checks record actual tool/file access separately from model-reported selections. Both live CLIs disable general shell/process/environment/discovery/browser/network tools and expose only an evaluator-owned MCP server launched through `env -i`, with exact-path reads and case-allowlisted atomic writes. Its root/path checks keep isolated runner credentials and arbitrary outbound access outside the model tool boundary. The schema rejects unknown families/modes, duplicate IDs, missing owners/rule IDs, dangling related-case IDs, missing skill/guide files, unknown validator IDs, unsafe setup commands, and impossible context budgets. Live results record schema version, case ID and prompt hash, tool/version/model, actual selected context, decisions, violations, duration, exit status, and pass/fail. They redact environment values, credentials, tokens, home paths, and private prompt bodies.

### Generated harness ownership manifest

`.ai/harness/manifest.json` records harness version, generator package version, emitted relative paths, content hashes, source kind (`generated`, `local-skill`, `external-override`), and whether a file may be user-edited. Regeneration follows the ownership state table above; no directory name alone establishes ownership.

## 📝 API Contracts

No HTTP API is added. The generated script interfaces are stable CLI contracts:

```text
yarn install-skills [existing flags]
yarn framework:context --module <id> [--query <text>] [--json]
yarn framework:context --package <@scope/name> [--query <text>] [--json]
yarn harness:validate [--case <id> | --family <name> | --all]
yarn harness:validate --runner <codex|claude> [--case/--family/--all] [--batch-size <n>] [--timeout <ms>]
yarn harness:fixture --case <id> --target <absolute-disposable-app> --acknowledge-writes
yarn harness:validate --runner <codex|claude> --case <id> --writable-root <absolute-disposable-app> --acknowledge-writes
yarn harness:validate --runner <codex|claude> --judge-writable-result <result.json> --writable-root <absolute-disposable-app> [--judge-validation-result <result.json>]
yarn harness:validate --runner <codex|claude> --review-writable-result <result.json> --writable-root <absolute-disposable-app> [--review-validation-result <result.json>]
yarn harness:release --runner <codex|claude> [--portability-runner <other-runner>] --prepare-targets <absolute-empty-directory> --acknowledge-writes
yarn mercato agentic:init [--tool <id>] [--update-harness | --force]
```

All commands default to read-only behavior. Routing evaluation runs inside a mandatory controller-owned host sandbox with only the selected app and isolated runner/output state mounted. Codex uses schema output and a permissive inner tool sandbox because nested macOS Seatbelt profiles cannot reliably read the already-contained app; the outer sandbox is the filesystem authority. Claude additionally uses plan permission mode, read-only tools, structured output, and no session persistence. Every case receives a fresh session (batching is orchestration only). Implementation/regression evaluation requires an explicitly disposable scaffold; the outer sandbox and post-run fingerprints restrict writes to `allowedWrites`. macOS `sandbox-exec` is supported for network-free lanes but shares the host network namespace, so the complete release command—which includes Playwright loopback lanes—requires Linux with Bubblewrap and user namespaces. Unsupported-host preflight exits before target preparation, provider invocation, or writable execution. Exit codes are `0` pass, `1` evaluated failure, and `2` invalid invocation/environment; timeouts/non-zero agent exits are failures with partial sanitized results. Results go under ignored `.ai/harness/results/`.

## 📝 UI/UX

No product UI changes. Developer-visible output follows these rules:

- context resolution prints the installed package version, ordered instruction chain, exact source root, bounded search command, and any skew warning;
- deterministic evaluation prints pass/fail per case and a concise owner/path explanation;
- live evaluation prints tool/model/version, case totals, failures, and the result artifact path;
- the installer prints selected local tiers, external result, canonical layout, and recovery command without exposing tokens or environment values.

## Optimization and Evaluation Use Cases

Every case is evaluated against a fresh standalone scaffold. Cases 57–70 are mandatory security/data-integrity regressions on every harness-affecting change; other cases run by affected router/skill/contract tags, with the full set at release time.

### Architecture, discovery, and planning

1. Explain the installed application architecture and enabled-module capabilities without assuming monorepo paths.
2. Decide between a new app module, UMES extension, module override, package installation, and eject-and-customize.
3. Locate an installed module's canonical entities, events, ACL, APIs/auth, DI, search entities, and widget host tokens.
4. Produce a one-shot library-management module plan using canonical framework primitives.
5. Split a large brief into cohesive specs only where capabilities are independently deployable.
6. Implement selected spec phases while leaving the app working after every phase.
7. Audit an app after a framework upgrade for stale imports, payloads, facts, migrations, and generated registries.
8. Analyze and safely disable unused built-in modules without breaking dependencies.

### Complete custom-module vertical slices

9. Add an editable entity with tenant/org scope, `updated_at`, validators, migration, snapshot, and optimistic locking.
10. Add related entities without direct cross-module ORM relationships.
11. Build list/detail/create/update/delete using `makeCrudRoute`, metadata, OpenAPI, indexer, and scoped responses.
12. Add a non-CRUD action endpoint using commands, mutation guards, optimistic locking, events, and undo where applicable.
13. Declare ACL features/dependencies, default role grants, and sync existing tenants.
14. Build backend list/create/edit/detail pages with `DataTable`, `CrudForm`, states, stable IDs, and conflict surfacing.
15. Add a public frontend page through auto-discovery.
16. Add a customer-portal page with `[orgSlug]`, customer auth/features, and portal navigation.
17. Configure full-text/token/vector search and verify reindex behavior.
18. Add typed events plus synchronous and asynchronous idempotent subscribers.
19. Add an idempotent explicitly tenant-wide scheduler worker with retry/concurrency/progress while preserving the installed nullable-organization contract and isolating organization-owned data.
20. Add notification types, renderers, and reactive client handlers.
21. Add tenant-tagged cache reads and write-path invalidation.
22. Add a module CLI command that works from published compiled packages.
23. Add module translations and reject user-facing hard-coded strings.
24. Add custom fields/custom entities with API/UI save-reload-clear round-trip coverage.

### UMES and app customization

25. Add a scoped response enricher with `enrichOne` and batched `enrichMany`.
26. Add an editable core `CrudForm` field using widget, read/enricher, and save/interceptor paths.
27. Add a DataTable column, filter, row action, bulk action, or toolbar item using stable host tokens.
28. Add or reorder main/settings/profile/topbar menu items.
29. Hide or replace an installed page through supported overrides without deleting framework code.
30. Replace, wrap, or transform props of an installed UI component.
31. Intercept an installed API request/response while preserving auth, scope, and body/query contracts.
32. Add a mutation guard that blocks or rewrites payloads and runs safe post-success callbacks.
33. Extend an installed data model through an extension entity/FK link.
34. React to a lifecycle event and degrade safely when an optional host module is absent.
35. Add DOM Event Bridge/SSE progress to a long-running operation.
36. Add a reactive notification side effect.
37. Gate an injected widget/page/menu with ACL including wildcard grants.
38. Add a feature toggle that hides UI and consistently blocks/degrades backend behavior.

### Integrations and providers

39. Build an app-local email integration with encrypted credentials, connection test, health, retry, and logs; do not invent a workspace, and branch to a separately published package only when reuse is explicit.
40. Build a shipping/carrier method using the provider package pattern.

### Evaluation levels and release matrix

All 203 cases have a deterministic catalog/owner/reference/budget check and a read-only routing assertion. That proves the correct context was selected; it does not claim that model-authored code works. The writable release target is 46 representative cases (22.7% of the catalog). A case counts toward that target only after its release-matrix entry, disposable fixture, controller-owned oracle, and narrow write allowlist land together; catalog classification alone does not make a case executable.

Executable coverage is distributed across these slices; the release matrix and trusted oracles must remain aligned for all 46 cases:

- module vertical slice: 9, 11, 12, 14;
- extension/UI: 26, 27, 29, 31;
- integration/AI/workflow: 42, 45, 49, 54;
- seeded regression fixtures: 57, 60, 61, 70;
- business command and workflow slices: 93, 105, 107, 122, 128, 133, 140;
- business UI and portal slices: 115, 130, 137, 165, 181;
- business AI and provider slices: 144, 146, 149, 150, 151, 153, 156;
- business test-authoring slices: 163, 164, 165;
- business regressions: 171, 172;
- complete standalone module: 185;
- field-tested generative regressions: 188, 189, 190, 191, 192.

Implementation cases use a fresh disposable scaffold, explicit allowed-write paths, deterministic fixture setup, expected artifacts, and executable validator IDs. A fixed controller-owned TypeScript AST oracle covers every registered writable case and rejects comment/import token stuffing; isolated mocked behavior probes additionally exercise provider/workflow effects and seeded regressions. The target cannot replace executable oracle code. The after phase also runs the target's fixed `yarn typecheck` gate. Every target command, including `yarn build`, runs with network mode `none`. Regression cases must fail their oracle before the agent change and pass it afterward. Provider cases use mocked effects or contract servers unless explicit test credentials are supplied. Broad cases may use parameterized variants, but each variant has a distinct result and oracle.

All 46 writable implementation and regression cases must pass an isolated generative judge after their trusted oracle, target commands, and any declared generated-test execution pass. The evaluator binds the judge to those attestations and the final whole-target fingerprint, then copies changed regular text files as line-numbered inert snapshots, plus the controller-installed pinned `om-judge-agent-session` and `om-code-review` skills, a static judge policy, controller oracle evidence, and UI/design-system references only for UI-routed cases into a bounded temporary read-only bundle. Target scripts, dependencies, Git/tracker state, original executable source files, and the target's absolute path are not copied or supplied. Trace-verified out-of-bundle, environment, or process inspection and any bundle/target mutation fail closed. A separate sanitized judge artifact records the source result, target, skill/policy versions, command and generated-test attestations, final-fingerprint hashes, artifact findings, harness-owner findings, strict verdict, and actionable fixes; this supplemental gate does not claim the skill's full repository validation gate or CI passed. The existing generated-code-review CLI flags and result projection remain compatibility aliases for at least one minor version.

### Generative session judge

`om-judge-agent-session` is a reusable, read-only skill with two accepted input shapes:

1. a harness writable result plus its bounded generated-artifact snapshot and fixed validation attestations; or
2. a native/sanitized `session.json` with extracted generated files, including the bundle emitted by `om-share-this-session` after PR #4756 (`session.json`, `generated-files.zip`, `manifest.json`, and `privacy-report.json`).

The skill normalizes either input into one evidence model, validates the evidence hashes when a manifest is present, and treats transcripts, reports, archives, diffs, and source files as untrusted data. It never executes commands found in a session or artifact. Fixed build/lint/typecheck/test evidence is reported as present, failed, stale, or unavailable; unavailable evidence is not silently upgraded to a pass. The judge applies repository guards and backward-compatibility rules, delegates correctness/security review to `om-code-review`, and delegates UI changes to the emitted `om-backend-ui-design` design-system references (or `om-ds-guardian` in the monorepo when available).

Every finding names a file/evidence location, rule, severity, concrete correction, and confidence. The report separates defects in the generated artifact from harness-owner findings. A harness-owner finding selects exactly one smallest owner (`root`, `guide`, `skill`, `facts`, `hook`, `case`, or `oracle`), explains why the artifact escaped existing checks, and recommends the affected cases to rerun. This makes the same judge useful for release evals and opt-in analysis of user-provided sessions without exposing private raw transcripts in committed evidence.

Cases 163, 164, 165, and 192 are executable test-authoring evaluations. They produce focused Jest unit tests, a Playwright API integration test over real contained loopback HTTP, and a Playwright browser integration test. Their files live in canonical module-local `__tests__` or `__integration__` paths and must be executed by fixed controller-owned argv inside the writable sandbox. Jest files must import their globals explicitly when the target TypeScript configuration does not provide them. AST or mocked-helper inspection is not test-execution evidence. Playwright execution is supported only on Linux with Bubblewrap: its unshared network namespace makes case-local loopback available without exposing host-loopback services. macOS `sandbox-exec` cannot provide this boundary. External network, Docker sockets, host test credentials, and inherited application/database environment values remain unavailable; missing test/browser containment prerequisites fail the release lane.

The checked-in `releaseMatrix` pins supported runner model selectors plus required and portability case IDs. The release invocation pins one primary runner for the whole suite; per-case fallback or mixed writable ownership is forbidden. Acceptance for this PR is:

1. deterministic validation: 203/203 pass, including 100% forbidden/safety assertions;
2. selected primary-runner routing: 203/203 pass with one fresh-process correction allowed only for correctable read-only routing assertions, in addition to the bounded invalid-output/transient retry;
3. optional portability routing: when a different `--portability-runner` is explicitly requested, the exact 46-case representative target passes with the same retry rule; when omitted, the release report records `portabilityRunner: null` and does not claim cross-model evidence;
4. writable implementation/regression: the selected primary runner owns all 46 cases, and every target oracle, fixed target command, declared generated test, duplicate normalized API/backend/frontend route guard, and mandatory generative judge passes;
5. results are produced from the final commit, record CLI/model versions and prompt hashes, and are summarized without committing raw private transcripts.

Primary-runner unavailability blocks claiming live release evidence; it does not invalidate deterministic CI. An unrequested secondary runner is not a release prerequisite. Once the portability lane is explicitly requested, its failures or unavailability fail that extended run. Primary runner, safety, forbidden-pattern, executable-oracle, validation, generated-test, duplicate-route, and generative-judge failures remain non-waivable. No score averaging hides a failed mandatory case.

### Backward-compatibility semantic coverage

The case assertions cover every frozen/stable surface even though the harness does not modify the runtime contracts: auto-discovery conventions; additive type/function changes; public import paths; event, widget spot, API route, DI, ACL, notification, and AI IDs; additive database schema; stable CLI commands/flags; and unchanged `.mercato/generated` bootstrap exports. Rename/removal prompts must route to deprecation/bridge/migration guidance. The setup smoke records the `.mercato/generated` export set before and after harness initialization and requires equivalence.

## Harness Evolution Workflow

`om-evolve-harness` makes new cases structured and repeatable:

1. Capture the failing prompt/transcript or source PR as untrusted evidence.
2. Classify and deduplicate it against case families/tags; scan the lesson index by the selected areas/modules/topics and open only matching records.
3. Reproduce it in a fresh scaffold pinned to explicit create-app/framework/agent versions.
4. Reduce the failure to semantic assertions rather than whole-file golden output.
5. Select exactly one smallest knowledge owner: root invariant, router row, conceptual guide, local skill reference, generated-fact extractor, external override/config, installer closure, or tool hook.
6. Run the new case before the edit and save the failure summary.
7. Update that owner only; references point to it instead of duplicating the rule.
8. Re-run the target case, related tagged cases, mandatory safety cases, context-budget gate, and scaffold smoke.
9. Register case metadata and update coverage/changelog; when the evidence is reusable app-local knowledge, update one focused lesson record and its index row.
10. Run `node scripts/check-lessons.mjs`, then report before/after evidence with exact agent and installed framework versions.

## 📝 Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios

- **Agentic setup skipped:** the fallback root remains safe and explains `yarn mercato agentic:init`; `yarn install-skills` placeholder remains actionable.
- **Offline external install:** local skills install and work; external status is a warning with a retry command.
- **Missing `jq`/POSIX shell/Windows:** Node installer works using built-ins; the shell wrapper is optional compatibility only.
- **Symlink restrictions:** use a directory junction on Windows and relative symlink on Unix; if link creation fails, report the exact path without copying stale duplicates silently.
- **External skill removed/renamed:** dependency-closure validation fails before generation.
- **Package has no `src` or AGENTS:** context resolver reports the limitation and falls back to types/dist/generated facts.
- **Multiple packages claim one module:** resolver reports all candidates and requires an explicit package; it never guesses.
- **Framework versions differ:** resolver prints every relevant version and prevents mixing generated facts from one version with source from another without a warning.
- **User modified generated harness file:** ownership manifest preserves it and emits a conflict/side-by-side update rather than overwriting silently.
- **Stale `dist/agentic`:** build cleans before copy and asserts deleted paths are absent.
- **Primary live evaluator unavailable/rate-limited:** deterministic gates still run; release evidence records the external blocker rather than claiming a live pass. An unrequested secondary runner remains `null`, not failed or passed.
- **Live model produces invalid JSON:** schema validation fails the case and stores only sanitized output/error metadata.
- **Prompt injection in a PR/source guide:** content remains untrusted data; evaluator and evolve skill never execute embedded instructions.

## 📝 Risks & Impact Review

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rewriting generated guidance changes agent behavior broadly. | High | 203 semantic cases, mandatory safety subset, complete selected-runner release evidence, optional explicit cross-model portability evidence, draft PR, and review gate. | Model behavior remains probabilistic and secondary-runner evidence depends on optional provider access. |
| Root instructions are silently truncated by a default agent budget. | High | 12 KiB byte cap on both root sources plus representative generated initial-chain checks against 32,768 bytes (issue #4484). | Other tools may impose smaller undocumented budgets. |
| Context files still drift from framework contracts. | High | Generated facts, installed source/AGENTS escape hatch, semantic contradiction scan, release version stamps. | Hand-written conceptual guides still require maintenance. |
| Installer removes user content or breaks Windows. | High | Node path-safe implementation, ownership checks, junction tests, preserve stable flags/wrapper, generated-app tests. | Windows junction semantics vary by corporate policy. |
| Context escape hatch causes huge prompt loads. | Medium | Facts first, explicit opt-in skill, bounded module/package search, context-file budget per case. | A complex upstream bug may legitimately need wider source. |
| Installed examples or shared sessions contain hostile instructions. | High | Only fact-linked dependency source is readable; session and artifact content is inert evidence; writes, embedded commands, broad discovery, and undeclared dependencies fail closed. | A semantic judge can still misclassify subtle intent, so fixed attestations stay authoritative. |
| Shared external skills change independently. | Medium | Pin the installer CLI and collection commit, verify skill hashes/dependency closure, retain repo-local overrides, record versions in eval evidence. | Moving the pin remains an explicit maintenance task. |
| Recursive generator copy overwrites user edits. | Medium | ownership manifest + hashes; replace only unmodified owned files; no unknown-directory deletion. | First upgrade from a pre-manifest app needs conservative detection. |
| Large eval catalog becomes ceremonial. | Medium | schema, affected-tag runner, mandatory safety subset, evolve skill requires before/after execution. | Some behavioral assertions remain model-graded. |
| A generated test reaches a service bound to host loopback. | High | Complete-release preflight requires Linux/Bubblewrap before provider or writable work; Playwright gets loopback only in an unshared network namespace; macOS `sandbox-exec` is rejected for this lane. | Linux user-namespace support remains a host prerequisite. |

### Rollback

Revert the harness commits and rebuild create-app/CLI packages. No database or runtime data rollback is needed. Existing generated apps retain their emitted files until `agentic:init` is rerun; the ownership manifest allows a later fixed generator to update only harness-owned files.

## Integration and Validation Coverage

No application HTTP endpoint or customer UI is changed. Integration coverage targets both harness emission paths and the developer workflows they control.

| Path | Coverage |
|---|---|
| Fresh `create-mercato-app --agents codex`, Claude, Cursor, and multi-agent selection | One authoritative root router; correct tool files; local/external skill layout; no unresolved placeholders. |
| Fresh scaffold with `--agents none` / skipped setup | Safe fallback `AGENTS.md`; placeholder installer points to `agentic:init`; app scaffold remains valid. |
| `yarn mercato agentic:init` first run and rerun | Same emitted tree as create-app; marker/ownership idempotency; user-authored files preserved; a symlinked managed ancestor fails before any outside write. |
| `yarn install-skills --no-external` | Default local skills and correct canonical/Claude link layout without network. |
| External install with fake/recorded skills CLI | Pinned CLI invocation, repeated skill flags, 15-skill default versus opt-in automation selection, dependency closure, all-set activation/rollback including prior-ledger restoration, retry semantics, external-before-local ordering. |
| Windows simulated filesystem/command resolution | Junction/link behavior and `.cmd` spawning. |
| `yarn framework:context --module customers` | Installed core version, root/package/module AGENTS chain, `src/modules/customers`, bounded no-ignore search. |
| Generated module facts | Source-linked API routes, backend pages, frontend pages, CLI commands, AI tools/MCP capabilities, AI agents, and correlated UMES hosts/contributions resolve exact targets and specialist routes without enabling broad dependency discovery; framework-owned hosts remain in the sibling framework extension catalog. |
| Missing source/duplicate module/version skew fixtures | Explicit degraded/ambiguous/skew output; no guessed edit path. |
| Deterministic harness validation | 203 schema-valid cases, existing references, no contradictory stale patterns, complete emitted module-fact coverage, context budgets, dependency closure. |
| Instruction-budget regression | Both root sources ≤12 KiB; named representative generated initial chains ≤32,768 bytes, measured as bytes. |
| Selected primary live runner | Codex or Claude read-only structured routing/decision result for all 203 cases, one fresh session per case. |
| Optional portability live runner | A different explicitly requested runner executes the exact 46-case representative read-only target; omission is recorded without blocking release. |
| Writable live runner | The selected primary runner owns disposable scaffolds and executable oracles for all 46 implementation/regression cases, with bounded controller-materialized installed-package context when declared by the case. |
| Writable route uniqueness | Every generated API, backend page, and frontend page route is normalized (including dynamic-segment names), compared with app-owned peers and the installed-route baseline in module facts, and duplicate URLs fail before semantic judging. Page metadata cannot override the filesystem-derived route used by the generator. |
| Generated test execution | Fixed-argv execution of the generated Jest units plus Linux/Bubblewrap-isolated Playwright API and browser cases in canonical module-local paths; a host-loopback listener remains unreachable. |
| Mandatory generative judge | Post-oracle/command/test judgment of every writable result in a bounded source-only bundle using `om-judge-agent-session`, pinned `om-code-review`, and the applicable design-system references. |
| User-shared session bundle | A PR #4756-compatible sanitized bundle is normalized, hash-checked, judged read-only, and reported without executing transcript or artifact instructions. |
| Generated standalone install/generate/typecheck/test/build | Real npm/Verdaccio package boundary and published-path validation. |
| Semantic smoke | `/login`, one CRUD plan/flow, one UMES flow, one worker/CLI flow, and package source-context lookup. |

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

All runtime framework contract surfaces remain unchanged. The scaffold/harness surfaces are handled as follows:

1. **CLI/package scripts:** existing `install-skills` name and installer flags stay stable. New `framework:context` and `harness:validate` scripts are additive. The shell script remains a compatibility wrapper.
2. **Skill IDs:** existing standalone skill names remain routable. New skills are additive. Shared external skill names remain installed from the collection.
3. **Generated paths:** `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/agentic.config.json`, `.ai/skills`, `.ai/guides`, and `.agents/skills` retain their meaning. New `.ai/harness` files and scripts are additive.
4. **Tool layouts:** Codex/Cursor keep canonical `.agents/skills`; Claude compatibility links remain. Legacy layouts are swept only when links resolve into harness-owned targets.
5. **Module facts:** entity IDs remain colon-form; API auth continues to come from generated `apis[].metadata`; files are stamped with source package version. Source roots, source-linked backend pages/CLI commands/AI tools/agents, and per-route source paths are additive; `cli: string[]` remains. No frozen ID is renamed/removed.
6. **Agentic rerun:** pre-manifest apps are migrated conservatively; unknown/user files are preserved. Generated marker blocks are replaced idempotently.
7. **Published assets:** `dist/agentic` cleanup removes stale generated artifacts before package publication, with tests to prevent deleted legacy skills from reappearing.
8. **Evaluator CLI/results:** `--judge-writable-result` is canonical; `--review-writable-result` and the existing generated-code-review result projection remain compatibility aliases for at least one minor release.

## 📋 Phasing

### Phase 1 — Specification and gates

Define architecture, cases/schema, ownership rules, compatibility, and pre-implementation audit. Land deterministic failing tests for current contradictions and installer portability before replacing content.

### Phase 2 — Root context and local skills

Replace both root instruction sources, split local skill procedures into references, add AI/workflow/context/evolve skills, fix tool entity guards, and retain existing skill IDs.

### Phase 3 — Installer and generator

Add the Node installer, compatibility wrapper, recursive asset emission, ownership manifest, upstream snapshots, source resolver, stale-dist cleanup, and create-app/CLI parity.

### Phase 4 — Evaluation and release proof

Add all case records, deterministic/live runner, focused/generated-app/Verdaccio validation, execute the full selected-primary-runner matrix plus an optional representative secondary portability matrix, and remediate failures.

## 📋 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Specification and gates

1. Finalize this spec from current scaffold/package/PR evidence and run the 13-surface compatibility audit.
2. Add case/result schemas, validator registry, release matrix, and tests that fail on missing paths/owners/rule IDs, duplicate IDs, dangling relations, excessive byte/token budgets, stale route/entity/signature patterns, unsafe commands, and unresolved references.
3. Add baseline cases for all 203 tasks and mark cases 57–70 mandatory.

### Phase 2: Root context and local skills

1. Rewrite template and agentic root files to the boundary-first router contract and dynamic module markers.
2. Replace the named local skills with thin routers and focused references; add `om-create-ai-agent`, `om-build-workflow`, `om-framework-context`, and `om-evolve-harness`.
3. Rewrite tool-specific enforcement/hooks to reference the canonical root and `data/entities.ts` path without duplicating architecture prose.
4. Run router/reference/size/semantic gates and the affected use-case families.

### Phase 3: Installer and generator

1. Implement/test `install-skills.mjs`, retain the shell wrapper, update every automatic call site plus manifest/schema/package scripts, and exercise offline/external/Windows layouts.
2. Replace hard-coded create-app/CLI skill copying with the shared recursive ownership-aware emitter and placeholder handling.
3. Clean/rebuild both create-app and CLI `dist/agentic` trees, bundle version/hash-stamped upstream root/BC snapshots in both, and assert stale paths are absent.
4. Implement/test `framework-context.mjs` against installed-source, missing-source, duplicate-module, and skew fixtures.

### Phase 4: Evaluation and release proof

1. Implement deterministic, read-only Codex/Claude routing, and writable disposable-scaffold evaluation modes plus sanitized result artifacts.
2. Generate a fresh standalone app, install local/external skills, resolve upstream context, and run deterministic validation.
3. Select Codex or Claude once for the release; run all 203 primary routing cases and all 46 primary-owned writable implementation/regression target oracles, generated tests, target commands, duplicate-route guards, and generative judges. Optionally request the other runner for the exact 46-case read-only portability target. Fix the smallest knowledge owner for each failure and rerun affected + mandatory cases.
4. Run create-app targeted tests, Verdaccio standalone parity where package boundaries changed, and the configured full repository gate.
5. Complete automated code review/autofix, final compliance report, PR evidence, and rollback notes.

## Final Compliance Report

| Check | Design verdict |
|---|---|
| Standalone-only placement | Implemented in create-app/CLI scaffold assets and tests; no core runtime business module or database contract changed. The root app files touched are required create-app template mirrors. |
| Tenant/security/data integrity | Implemented as universal boundaries, mandatory cases 57–70, writable oracles, and contained release execution; no runtime data access was added. |
| Canonical module mechanisms | Implemented through routed guides/skills, generated installed-module facts, and exact installed source plus nearest `AGENTS.md` resolution. |
| Backward compatibility | Implemented with stable script/skill/path contracts, additive commands/files, conservative reruns, and ownership-aware upgrades. |
| Progressive disclosure | Implemented with byte-guarded compact roots, branch-specific references, facts-first context, and measured per-case budgets. |
| External skill dependency closure | Implemented with an explicit exact pin, per-skill hashes, source/stage/install verification, ownership ledger, and no local/external duplication. |
| Cross-platform installer | Implemented with Node path handling, simulated Windows command/junction coverage, and no `jq`/POSIX dependency; the complete release gate intentionally fails closed on native macOS and Windows because only Linux/Bubblewrap provides isolated loopback. |
| Integration coverage | Implemented for fresh/skipped/rerun/install/context/eval/Verdaccio and semantic smoke paths. |
| New feature integration tests | Three generated test cases execute a focused Jest unit test, real loopback Playwright API test, and real Playwright browser test under release containment. |
| Rollback | Revert and rebuild; no data migration. |

## Changelog

- **2026-08-03** — Added OMH-203 for CRM detail-tab UMES routing, extended bounded installed framework context to read-only routing cases, enforced guidance-before-source ordering, and synchronized the 203-case contract across schema, tests, and release documentation.
- **2026-08-03** — Replaced the standalone monolithic lesson placeholder with a tagged progressive index plus one-record template, made nested lesson records user-editable in both copy-pipeline manifests, added the shared consistency checker, and taught root/evolution routing to load only area/module/topic matches.
- **2026-08-01** — Strengthened OMH-088/089 and targeted enricher/interceptor/guard/form/table/menu/DOM/portal cases around fact-first UMES target resolution, correlation provenance, every bound CrudForm/DataTable family, framework-owned hosts, and exact unified override modes; the UMES umbrella spec is optional provenance only and remains unnecessary in emitted standalone apps.
- **2026-08-01** — Expanded OMH-006/OMH-168 and aligned the interactive standalone `om-implement-spec` owner with shared `om-auto-implement-spec` resolution, planning/progress, report-section, and stable `Spec:` reference contracts while retaining user confirmation and no-PR local delivery.
- **2026-07-24** — Skeleton created under the autonomous Open Questions policy; standalone boundary, source-context, evaluation, and migration assumptions resolved from the user brief.
- **2026-07-24** — Added prior-spec/PR-history findings, the initial case catalog, thin-skill/router architecture, cross-platform installer, exact installed-source escape hatch, harness-evolution workflow, compatibility, failure scenarios, integration coverage, and phased implementation plan.
- **2026-07-24** — Added a three-axis context assembler, 12 business one-shot cases, four test authoring/execution cases, and byte-accurate issue #4484 instruction-budget regressions.
- **2026-07-24** — Added exact discovery-surface and 18-domain override catalogs plus public frontend, portal, design-system, UX, accessibility, and state-matrix coverage.
- **2026-07-24** — Source-audited those catalogs against current generators/types/docs; added vector and locale discovery, query/sync/reactive/DOM/integration mechanisms, additive AI overrides, exact registry keys, portal frozen IDs, and corrected design-system exceptions.
- **2026-07-24** — Fresh-context and pre-implementation reviews split routing evidence from writable implementation/regression oracles, pinned the external collection, defined concern-specific instruction precedence, added ownership state transitions, expanded all 14 BC assertions, and made create-app/CLI snapshot and installer call-site parity explicit.
- **2026-07-24** — Added a fail-closed writable-fixture materializer with exact case-bound markers, seed-to-write-scope validation, controller-target isolation, and executable regression seeds for the initial implementation matrix.
- **2026-07-24** — Restored standalone provider placement (local module by default, separately published dependency for explicit reuse) and scope-contract nuance for authorized tenant-wide/system jobs without weakening organization-owned data isolation.
- **2026-07-24** — Reviewer hardening made duplicate module-fact providers fail closed unless `src/modules.ts` selects one exact package; framework context now recognizes dist-only roots, compares fact package and version stamps, validates materialization path segments, and emits deterministic globally capped search artifacts with explicit status.
- **2026-07-24** — Replaced writable token scans with controller-owned AST and isolated behavior oracles, made every seeded fixture fail its precondition, added the fixed after-phase typecheck gate, and prevented writable targets from supplying executable validation code.
- **2026-07-24** — Compacted the generated enabled-module marker from per-module description/path rows to an identifier-only index with one progressive fact-sheet path rule, preserving enabled/bundled selection and fallback semantics while keeping compound routing under the initial context budget.
- **2026-07-24** — Added an independent generated-code review lane for all 31 one-shot implementation cases, binding the pinned installed `om-code-review` skill to passing target-command attestation, controller oracle evidence, and the final post-build fingerprint inside a bounded source-only bundle with sanitized strict verdict artifacts.
- **2026-07-24** — Doubled the catalog to 184 cases, grouped cases 93–184 by developer outcome, and set the writable release target to 39 cases with aligned fixture, oracle, real generated-test, mandatory review, evaluator, and release-matrix gates.
- **2026-07-24** — Strengthened the release target to 39 cases (21.2%), made generated-code review mandatory for every writable implementation/regression, and added fixed-argv execution of generated Jest, Playwright API, and Playwright browser tests under fail-closed host containment.
- **2026-07-25** — Replaced the non-waivable dual-provider release dependency with one explicit primary runner that owns all blocking live lanes, plus an optional distinct 39-case read-only portability runner recorded separately in release evidence.
- **2026-07-25** — Made the complete release gate require trusted Linux/Bubblewrap after proving macOS `sandbox-exec` shares host loopback; preflight rejects untrusted/no-op/pass-through runtimes and proves private loopback before target/provider/write activity, all build validation is network-free, and Playwright loopback stays inside an unshared namespace.
- **2026-07-27** — Hardened review portability and safety: ownership-aware staging preserves unowned skills, framework-context scans are NUL-safe and symlink-contained, writable behavior probes safely stub trusted imports, entity oracles honor explicit database-field mappings, provider quota/authentication failures abort as environment failures, and macOS/manual fixture prerequisites are documented.
- **2026-07-28** — Expanded the catalog to 187 cases and the writable/review matrix to 40; added complete-module, cache, and queue coverage; made case-schema validation executable through OMH-187; audited all 53 emitted module facts into catalog coverage; added contrastive decision vocabularies; and wired bounded controller-materialized installed-package context into declared writable cases without relaxing the dependency-tree ban.
- **2026-07-28** — Added field-tested writable OMH-188–191 and combined CRM/library OMH-192; extended the writable/review matrix to 45, added a fourth executable generated-test lane, fixed exact-string oracle execution, enforced command-local atomic/undo seams, and tightened scope, lifecycle, concurrency, CRM-link, worker-scope, and Jest review rules.
- **2026-07-29** — Re-audited Zielivia's original and generated-case findings plus #4564/#4565/#4571/#4572 against their executable owners, synchronized the remaining overview/risk counts to 192, and proved final27 deterministic 192/192; the selected live runner matrices remain the delivery gate.
- **2026-07-30** — Completed PR #4529's merge-focused remediation: final emitted controllers pass deterministic 192/192; OMH-188–192 pass focused live routing on default Codex, Claude Sonnet, and high-effort gpt-5.4-mini; repeated OMH-185 writable attempts produced actionable root-contract fixes but the final fresh attempt reached its fixed 600-second ceiling and is excluded from pass evidence. Complete 192-case primary plus 45-case writable/review release certification, with generative cases prioritized and Claude non-blocking when unavailable, continues in #4670 without weakening trace, containment, scope, or oracle contracts.
- **2026-07-31** — Added OMH-193 as the business-language parity evaluation for OMH-185, reusing its complete-module fixture and oracle while requiring the harness to infer canonical CRUD, safety, search, localization, and extension decisions without prompt-level framework prescriptions; expanded the catalog/release matrix to 193/46 without changing existing case contracts.
- **2026-08-01** — Added a reusable read-only generative session judge for all writable evals and PR #4756 user-shared bundles; made installed `@open-mercato` source a fact-linked warning-level read context; expanded module facts with source-linked routes/pages/commands/AI tools/agents; and made duplicate normalized API/backend/frontend routes a non-waivable fixed guard.
- **2026-07-27** — Added two installed-module-facts routing cases (OMH-194 dictionaries, OMH-195 api_keys), corrected the published case schema so it accepts the catalog it pins, added a drift guard binding the shipped catalog to that schema's own patterns and count, and aligned the remaining operational release counts.
- **2026-07-28** — Audited every shipped module fact-sheet against the catalog and closed the last six gaps (OMH-196 configs, OMH-197 perspectives, OMH-198 resources, OMH-199 sync_excel, OMH-200 gateway_stripe, OMH-201 sync_akeneo), so all 47 fact-sheets a scaffold ships are now routed by at least one case and a build guard fails when a newly enabled module has none. Deterministic validation now also measures each case's declared context on disk and rejects budgets that case cannot satisfy; OMH-111, OMH-146, and OMH-169 were widened from measured footprints, keeping the global file/byte, safety, write, oracle, and review limits unchanged.
- **2026-07-30** — Routed the newly enabled `wms` fact-sheet with OMH-202, then merged #4529's head and renumbered this work's nine cases because the parent had independently claimed OMH-188…192 for writable cases of its own; `relatedCases` were repointed with the IDs so no case silently references a different one. After #4759 landed first with OMH-193, the cases shifted once more to OMH-194…202. The catalog is 202 cases with a 46-case writable/portability sample, and every published count — the two user docs, the release README, the `--portability-runner` help text, and the two `om-evolve-harness` references — is now bound to the catalog by a guard instead of maintained by hand.
